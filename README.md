# Mobius

Mobius is a functional reactive framework for managing state evolution and side-effects, with add-ons for connecting to Android UIs and RxJava Observables. It emphasizes separation of concerns, testability, and isolating stateful parts of the code.

To learn more, see the [wiki](https://github.com/spotify/mobius/wiki) for a user guide. You can also
watch a [talk from Android @Scale introducing Mobius](https://www.facebook.com/atscaleevents/videos/2025571921049235/).

## Status

Mobius is in Beta status, meaning it is used in production in Spotify Android applications, but
we may keep making changes relatively quickly.

Mobius is currently built for Java 7 (because Java 8 is not fully supported on all versions of Android), hence the duplication of some concepts defined in `java.util.function` (see `com.spotify.mobius.functions`).

When using Mobius, we do however recommend using Java 8 or later, primarily because of the improved type inference and because using lambdas greatly improves readability and conciseness of code.

## Using it in your project

The latest version of Mobius is available through Maven Central (LATEST_RELEASE below is ![latest not found](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.spotify.mobius/mobius-core.svg)):

```groovy
implementation 'com.spotify.mobius:mobius-core:LATEST_RELEASE'
testImplementation 'com.spotify.mobius:mobius-test:LATEST_RELEASE'

implementation 'com.spotify.mobius:mobius-rx:LATEST_RELEASE'       // only for RxJava 1 support
implementation 'com.spotify.mobius:mobius-rx2:LATEST_RELEASE'      // only for RxJava 2 support
implementation 'com.spotify.mobius:mobius-android:LATEST_RELEASE'  // only for Android support

```

## Building

### Formatting

We're using Google's auto-formatter to format the code. The build pipeline is set up to fail builds that aren't correctly formatted. To ensure correct formatting, run

```bash
./gradlew format
```
